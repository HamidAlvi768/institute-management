Okay, I understand the requirement. You want the labels on the x-axis of your chart, which represent department names, to be shortened. For example, instead of showing "Punjab Education Department", you want it to display just "Education".

Your current `getShortDept` function removes " Department" from the end, which would turn "Punjab Education Department" into "Punjab Education".

To achieve the desired outcome ("Education"), you need to modify the `getShortDept` function to remove both the potential province prefix (like "Punjab ", "Sindh ", etc.) and the " Department" suffix.

Here's the updated `getShortDept` function:

```javascript
// Helper to get short department name by removing province prefix and 'Department' suffix
const getShortDept = (fullName) => {
  if (!fullName || typeof fullName !== 'string') {
    return '';
  }

  let shortName = fullName.trim();

  // 1. Remove " Department" suffix (case-insensitive)
  shortName = shortName.replace(/ Department$/i, '').trim();

  // 2. Define known prefixes (provinces/regions - add more if needed)
  const prefixes = [
    'Punjab',
    'Sindh',
    'KPK', // Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
    'Balochistan',
    'Islamabad',
    'Federal',
    'Azad Jammu Kashmir', // Example for multi-word
    'Gilgit Baltistan'    // Example for multi-word
    // Add other potential prefixes here
  ];

  // 3. Remove the prefix if the name starts with one
  for (const prefix of prefixes) {
    // Use regex to match the prefix at the beginning, case-insensitive, followed by a space
    const regex = new RegExp(`^${prefix}\\s+`, 'i');
    if (regex.test(shortName)) {
      shortName = shortName.replace(regex, '').trim();
      break; // Stop after finding the first matching prefix
    }
  }

  // If after removing prefix and suffix, the name is empty, maybe return the original minus suffix?
  // Or just return the potentially empty string. Let's return the processed name.
  // Example: If input was "Punjab Department", it becomes "Punjab" after step 1, then "" after step 3.

  return shortName;
};
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Robust Input Check:** Added a check to ensure `fullName` is a non-empty string.
2.  **Trim:** Added `trim()` at the beginning and after each replacement to handle extra whitespace.
3.  **Suffix Removal:** Kept the existing logic to remove " Department" from the end, case-insensitively.
4.  **Prefix Definition:** Created an array `prefixes` containing known province/region names that might appear at the start of the department name. **Crucially, add any other relevant prefixes to this list.**
5.  **Prefix Removal:**
    * Iterated through the `prefixes` array.
    * For each prefix, created a regular expression (`RegExp`) to check if `shortName` *starts* with that prefix followed by one or more space characters (`\\s+`). The `^` anchors the match to the beginning of the string, and `i` makes it case-insensitive.
    * If a match is found (`regex.test(shortName)`), replaced the prefix and the following space(s) with an empty string (`shortName.replace(regex, '')`).
    * Added `break;` to stop checking for other prefixes once one is found and removed (assuming a department name won't start with multiple province names).
6.  **Return Value:** Returns the processed `shortName`.

**Integration:**

You don't need to change anything else in your `InstituteMetricsChart` component. The existing code already calls `getShortDept` correctly when building the `departments` array for the x-axis categories:

```javascript
// Inside the Provincial Flow
if (filteredData.length > 0) {
  // This line correctly uses the updated getShortDept
  const departments = filteredData.map(d => getShortDept(d.department));
  const entityLabel = getEntityLabel(selectedProvince);
  chartData = {
    series: getSeriesForView(selectedView, filteredData),
    options: buildChartOptions(departments, entityLabel, selectedView), // 'departments' now contains short names
    type: 'bar',
  };
}

// Inside the Federal Flow
if (filteredData.length > 0) {
    // This line also correctly uses the updated getShortDept
    const departments = filteredData.map(d => getShortDept(d.department));
    const entityLabel = getEntityLabel(selectedProvince); // Still 'Department'
      chartData = {
      series: getSeriesForView(selectedView, filteredData),
      options: buildChartOptions(departments, entityLabel, selectedView), // 'departments' now contains short names
      type: 'bar',
    };
  }
```

By replacing the old `getShortDept` function with the new one provided above, your chart should now display the shortened department names (like "Education", "Technical Education", "Vocational Training") on the x-axis when the provincial or federal filters are active. The default view showing province names will remain unchanged.
